My name is Ela. I'm looking for new challenges and oppurtunities !

- I'm currently learning Golang with a big interest in Backend Development.
- For two months, I have attended the Immersive Program at Alterra Academy. During the program, I have learned about Backend Development, such as building a REST-ful API project using Golang, Echo Framework, MySQL, GORM, unit testing, CI/CD and deploying the project on AWS and Okteto.
